A few exercises for a summerschool on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition

Exercise 1
Plot the first and last time instances of U and V in a contour plot. 
-- Note: The data has virtually no temporal evolution, however, this is besides the point for the current exercises.

Exercise 2
Reorganize the data within U and V so each velocity field may be decomposed separately

Exercise 3
Implement POD within the "POD" function and run the routine.

Exercise 4
Plot the POD eigenvalues using loglog - what do you see?

Exercise 5
Plot the first 8 POD modes - what do you see? How do the modes correspond to the eigenvalues?
